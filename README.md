## How To Play

### With touch:

Tap the bottom-left corner button to open Settings.  
By default you can move one finger everywhere, the bottom HUD would be just the conviniet area to place it.  
Settings: if you enable "Press HUD" mode you would then need to press the left or right arrows of bottom HUD to move the paddle instead of panning the finger everywhere

### With keyboard/mouse/controller:

Left, Right to move Paddle  
Up, Down to move inside Settings  
Space/Enter, to Fire  
Esc to open Settings
